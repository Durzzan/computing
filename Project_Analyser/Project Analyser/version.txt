        *** New code review rules (31 rules) ***
         - Magic number found
           A numeric literal is not defined as a constant.
         - Verify accuracy
           A floating point constant may be imprecise.
         - Optional parameter never passed a value
           An Optional parameter is never passed as a call argument.
         - Empty block
           This rule reports empty blocks such as If, Else, Catch.
         - Slow ^ operator found
           Replace ^ by one or more multiplications.
         - CreateObject found
           Use "As New" early binding instead of late binding.
         - Possibly orphaned event handler
           Sub no longer handles any events.
         - Event handler called directly
           Event handlers should not be explicitly called.
         - Implementation called directly
           Should not call a procedure that implements an interface.
         - Event handler should be Private
           Prevent other modules from calling it directly.
         - Implementation should be Private
           Prevent other modules from calling it directly.
         - Non-instantiatable class has instance members
           Instance members are inaccessible.
         - Class/Structure nested inside Interface
           Bad programming style.
         - Unreachable code found
           A block of code never executes because it is not reachable.
         - Variable read before written (along some path)
           Potential logic mistake.
         - Variable read before written
           Variable always contains its default value at this point.
         - Object read before written (along some path)
           Run-time error (null pointer reference) could occur.
         - Object read before written
           Run-time error (null pointer reference) is likely.
         - Assigned value not used
           Useless assignment, check logic.
         - Assigned object not used
           Useless assignment, check logic.          
         - Parameter value not used
           Logic flaw: Parameter is overwritten before ever read.
         - Passed value not used
           Receiving procedure doesn't use a value. Could optimize.
         - Loop runs only once
           Potential logic flaw. Why loop just 1 time?
         - Loop runs forever
           No reachable exit from this loop. Potential jam.
         - Condition always True or False at run-time
           Statement is unconditional due to run-time conditions.
         - Rewrite Sub as Function
           Use return value instead of 'out' parameter.

        New review rules that replace old rules:
         - Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility imported 
           Replaces old rule "Microsoft.VisualBasic imported"
           The Compatibility namespace is a style problem while the 
           VisualBasic namespace is not. (reported by Eric Burdo)
         - Conditional block excluded
           #If or #Else block condition is False.
           Replaces old rule "Conditional block will not upgrade to 
           VB.NET" and is now available in all editions.

        3 rules replace old rule "Return and Exit statement found":
         - Exit Sub|Function|Property found
         - Exit statement found (other Exit statements)
         - Return statement found (VB.NET)
           (idea by Martin Baum)


        *** Code review rules changed ***
        1. Short name: 
           - New option to allow single-character local variables 
             (i, j, k...) used as For index variables. 
           - Removed option to allow single-character local integers.
           - Allow e As System.EventArgs in VB.NET
           - Allow Catch ex [As Exception] in VB.NET
           - Allow any parameter length in DLL declarations
           - Allow numeric x and y used as a pair of parameters or local
             variables.
           - Report short names of Enum constants and Type fields.
        2. Initializer missing for variable:
           - Now raised for Shared fields of a Structure
        3. Dead variable: Variables in VB.NET Structures marked with
           <ComVisible(True)> are exposed. They may be used via COM
           and are not reported as dead code unnecessarily.
        4. ByVal parameter written to:
           - Shows up at every location where a write happens.
           - Doesn't show up where a potential write can't be verified.
        5. Conditional error handling is no longer reported as a missing
           error handler. Example of an acceptable error handler:
           If Not DebugMode Then On Error Goto x
        6. Default member variables are no longer reported as dead code.
        7. Problem list to show max 20,000 problems at a time.

        *** New reports ***   
        1. Variable list. Shows all variables and data type summary.
        2. Constant list. Shows all constants and data type summary.
        3. Procedure references report: Shows procedure call sites.
        4. Variable references report: Shows access to each variable.
        5. Constant references report: Shows access to each constant.
        6. String literal report: Shows all string literals with
           context. Lists all strings alphabetically, ready for copying 
           to a translator or a spell checker.

        *** Report improvements ***
        1. File list with details improved.
        2. Procedure list: Added color. Removed binary procedures.

        9. PDF reports: Line wrapping improved.
        10.PDF reports saved from Display window include page headers
           and a PDF outline (instead of TOC).
        11.Module interface report: Sorted hierarchically.
        12.Module members report: Sorted hierarchically.

           - find case-insensitively (request of Richard Brooker)
           - return duplicates within a single file as well
        2. Archive feature rewritten.
        3. Project Metrics .mtx files are now considerably smaller.
        4. New comment directive options:
           IN_THIS_PROJECT affects all files in project
           ANYWHERE affects all files in analysis
           WHERE expression affects all lines containing expression
        5. Syntax errors with comment directives now displayed.
        6. Considerable performance boost with large XML literals.
        7. Project Metrics reports are now encoded in UTF-8.

        *** Analysis improvements ***
        1. Improved detection of default member references.
        2. Improved detection of COM in/out ByRef parameters.
        3. Improved accuracy of Overloads resolution.
        4. Improved accuracy of type inference.

        8. Improved handling of generic types.
        9. Syntax obj=value is no longer treated as a write to obj 
           in classic VB. Writing requires the Set obj=value syntax.
        10.Letting a new value to an object's default property is now
           analyzed more accurately. Syntax obj=value in classic VB.
        11.Added support (no functionality) for XML Axis Properties:
           .<tag> and ...<tag> and .@<attrib>
        12.Added support for Widening Operator CType conversions in
           overloaded calls.

        *** Bug fixes ***
        1. Fixed Procedure list with details. 
           #Compiler directive lines were sometimes appearing 
           instead of procedure header.
        2. Fixed 2 errors with XAML .g.vb files (with VB2008 SP1):
           File not up-to-date, rebuild project
           File not found, rebuild project
        3. Fixed support for #If and #ElseIf without Then.
        4. Fixed several issues with generic type parameters (Of T).
        5. Fixed hang with Procedure call tree (all procedures).
        6. Fixed rules "Case overlap" and "Case useless": bug if
           Case statement was followed by a comment.
        7. Fixed rule "Case useless": Case 1 To 3 followed by Case 2 
           was incorrectly reported as "Case overlap" and not "useless".
        8. "For Each x In y" is treated as a write instruction to x, 
           no longer as a write+read.
        9. Fixed error with projects having a project-level compilation
           constants setting longer than 255 characters.
        10.In the hypertext view, if you had two different definitions 
           with the same name (e.g. Form1.MyVar and Form2.MyVar), both
           could have been highlighted in red. Now clicking on either
           MyVar will only display the selected MyVar in red.
        11.Reports will be created under the system TEMP directory 
           by default. Fixes UAC problems writing to Program Files
           folder. User can define any other directory for reports.
        12.Problems are now hidden for some generated .Designer.vb files
           that were erroneously treated as regular non-generated code.
        13.Fixed auto-fix bug with '! If..Then split: 
           End If was incorrectly placed before If. (Gaby Weizman)
        14.Fixed auto-fix bug with "" being replaced by vbNullString
           where "" was a quotation mark.
        15.Fixed Project Metrics "Project in time" tab, where case
           differences in a name would hide some values for the 
           selected file, class, procedure or variable.

        *** Replaced features and breaking changes ***
        1. Variables and constants report has been replaced by
           Variable list and Constant list.
        2. Macro "Report VarsNConsts" now unsupported. Replace by:
           Report Variables
           Report Constants
        3. Macro command Analyze supports new parameter BIN.
           Parameter COM is obsoleted but supported.
        4. Project Metrics .html report format changed. This only
           affects you if you parse the reports programmatically.
        5. Auto-fix replacement of "" with vbNullString has been
           disabled in VB.NET. Use of vbNullString may cause subtle
           run-time bugs in VB.NET.

        2. Fixed display glitches on high resolution displays,
           Vista/Windows 7 high DPI settings. (Tom Owen)
        3. Workaround for font size issue in Problem Options (Tom Owen)
        4. Fixed bug with VB2008 code that uses an <attribute>

        3. Fixed errors outputting very large PDF.

v9.0.08 January 2010
        *** Improvements ***
        1. Need report accuracy improved. Where individual constants of
           an Enum are required (instead of the entire Enum), only the 
           required constants are listed. In addition, the module of
           that Enum is listed in the Modules required section. The same
           improvement also applies to individual fields of a Type.
        2. Problem "GoTo/GoSub statement found" now displays target
           line. (idea by Martin Baum)

           analyzing very large systems.
        2. Fixed property references to COM files being ignored.
        3. Fixed precedence bug with a COM library and a VB project
           declaring the same name. Now VB names always take precedence.
           (Klaus Lair)
        4. Fixed Overflow in phase 2/2 with #-character syntax such as 
           Case 3456000000# To 63115200000# (John Crellin)
        5. Fixed date/time literal evaluation bugs.
        6. Fixed date/time literal evaluation earlier than #12/30/1899#

        2. Local constants are properly evaluated for rules such as 
           Condition always True.
        3. Some auto-generated .g.vb files were not analyzed, causing
           extra dead code warnings with XAML forms. (Gunnar Syrén)

v9.0.03 February 2009
        *** Bug fixes ***
        1. In VB2005 and later, regular .exe projects can be referenced 
           by external projects. This fix removes unnecessary dead code 
           problems, but may cause new "dead but exposed" warnings.
           (Jeremy Yoder)
        2. Problem filter <Dead code + exposed> automatically changed
           to <Dead>. Fixed.
        3. Fixed 'This program might not have installed correctly' after 
           Configuration (config.exe) in Windows Vista.

v9.0.02 January 2009
        *** Bug fixes ***
        1. Keyword Me was handled incorrectly when tlbinf32.dll was 
           included in analysis. (Sergey Likhoded)
        2. Support for <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()>
           was missing. (Anko Groenewegen)
        3. Extension method that extends an unknown type is marked as
           live method to prevent a false dead code alarm.
        4. Fixed XML handling bug with VB2008 causing a hang/crash.
           Bug happened with syntax like <%= .<tag>.Value %>
           (Conrad Reynolds)

v9.0.01 October 2008
        *** Improvements and new features ***
        1. Support for Visual Basic 2008.
        2. Export source code as PDF.

        4. View contents of COM and DLL files as pseudo-code.
        5. View binary files with built-in hex viewer.
        6. Analyze all source files in a sub-directory tree. Analyze
           projects without a .vbproj or a .sln file.
        7. Module list report classifies modules into groups such as
           Definitions, Interface, Abstract class, Concrete class, 
           Stateless class, Dialog, Standard module and the like.
           Useful for learning to understand an existing project.
        8. <Flaw finder> set of code review rules helps locate logical
           mistakes and omissions and prevent future errors.

        *** Improved features ***
        1. Unicode support for international characters was added to:
           - Hypertext view
           - Reports (Display, HTML, MHT, RTF)
           - PDF reports (Latin-based, Greek and Cyrillic characters)
           - Copy to Clipboard (RTF)
           - Export code (RTF, HTML, Unicode text)
           - Project Metrics
        2. Option to load international source in a different codepage.
        3. Report enhancements:
           - Variables and constants report rewritten for clarity.
             Added underlying numeric constant values.
           - Variable use report shows variable deadness status.
           - File sizes and dates report shows line count and file age.
           - Library report shows image base addresses for optimizing 
             the base address of your library projects.
           - Dictionary report displays new statistics on names.
        4. PDF reports greatly improved.
        5. Image version and compile time displayed for library files.
        6. Syntax formatting for .sln files in hypertext and print-outs.
        7. Find window improved:
           - Results displayed in an easier-to-read format
           - Option to search for "Code or String" (Klaus Lair)
        8. Print code: New option "Bracket structures" emphasizes
           conditionals and loops. (Trevor Tregellas)
        9. Auto-fix now preserves existing line continuation characters
           (_) when possible. A continued line gets reformatted only
           when the particular line is auto-fixed.
        10.Analyze several directory trees by creating a .lst file.
        11.Compatibility library detected for classic VB projects.

        *** VB2008 support details ***
        1. Option Infer
        2. Extension methods: <Extension()>
        3. Nullable types
        4. Object initializers: New With { .field=value }
        5. <InternalsVisibleTo> attribute
        6. Lambda expressions: Function(x). Partial support.
        7. LINQ
        8. WPF/XAML projects
        9. If() function

        *** Improved analysis ***
        1. Added support for single-line Type and Enum blocks.
           (Les Sullivan)
        2. Classic VB: Added support for single-line declarations such
           as Dim x:Dim y or Sub x:End Sub.
        3. Added support for date literals #10/5/2008 11:25:00#
        4. Arrays declared with ReDim (without Dim) are now detected 
           in classic VB.
        5. Support for generic Structure and Interface (Of T)
        6. Support for Structures implementing an Interface.
        7. Overloads resolution improved. The correct Overloads
           procedure is now picked more often.
        8. Accuracy of late-bound call resolution improved by taking
           account the number of call arguments. (idea by Steve Gilbert)
        9. COM procedures. If an Optional parameter has an Enum data
           type and a default value, the name of the respective Enum
           constant is displayed as the default.

        *** Problem detection improvements ***
        1. Option to Ignore dead Property Get/Set/Let if another one
           lives. This option allows read&write properties even if read
           or write is dead. (Ian Digby)
        2. Special warning for an empty procedure when it Overrides
           an ancestor class procedure. Empty Overrides deletes
           functionality of an ancestor class, which is bad class
           design.
        3. Unused file problem is enhanced in a multi-project analysis. 
           It now verifies use for each project separately. You can
           then exclude the file from some projects and keep it in those
           projects where it is used.
        4. Option to switch Dead parameter rule on/off.
           (idea by Jean-François Ménard)
        5. Overrides procedures are not subject to NameCheck, since
           their name is defined in an ancestor class. (Alex Mauer)
        6. Microsoft.VisualBasic imported rule checks project-level
           imports in addition to Imports statements. (Eric Burdo)
        7. More accurate rules for Excess Scope problem (classic VB).

        *** Performance improvements ***
        1. Reduced analysis time at end of phase 2/2.
        2. Faster processing of overly large Enums (such as 9000 lines).
        3. Project Metrics Viewer loads large .mtx files faster.

        *** Bug fixes ***
        1. Fixed Unicode character width problems in "Print code"
           feature.
        2. "Initializer missing for variable" is not reported for arrays
           with defined bounds. Cannot be initialize them. (Alex Mauer)
        3. Fixed bug where calls to Events declared "As EventHandler" 
           were not found from implementing classes. This lead to extra 
           "Event not raised" warnings. (Charles Loreja)
        4. Fixed crash reading some OCX properties. (Chaudier Guillaume)
        5. Fixed bug where COM analysis ignored files with LCID<>0 in a 
           VB 2002/2003 project. Sample file: XL5EN32.OLB.
        6. Fixed .NET startup form being reported as dead.
        7. The rule Option Strict missing was accidentally labeled 
           Option Strict Off in Problem Options. The rule considers 
           that an Option Strict Off statement is intentional, not a
           problem. A problem is triggered when project-level Option
           Strict is Off and there is no Option Strict statement in a
           file. To search for any Option Strict Off statements, do 
           a simple Find.
        8. Support added for Shared Event and Shared Custom Event.
        9. Fixed Save WMF/EMF in Project Graph.
        10.Added missing support for ReadOnly variables.
        11.Added missing support for Sub New in a Module.
        12.Added missing support for generic procedures (Of T)
        13.FRX file viewer did not always save icons and cursors 
           correctly. (Jan Polonský)
        14.Scope declaration missing no longer reported for a Shared 
           Sub New, because it you can't declare one. (Alex Mauer)
        15.Fixed dead code detection with Type fields declared As New.
        16.Dictionary report showed too low Unique names count.
        17.Fixed display problems with line continuation characters, 
           especially in Hypertext view, code print-outs and 
           Project Printer.
        18.Reduced flickering in Hypertext and Report views.
        19.Fixed crash in Enterprise Diagrams, File belongs to project
           diagram when analyzing a project directory without a 
           project file. (Richard Hurst)
        20.Saving metrics as a .xml file produced invalid XML for
           characters beyond Unicode &H7FFF (such as in Japanese).
        21.Fixed handling of keyword New in Dim x, y As New datatype.
        22.Fixed unnecessary warnings for IIf() and Choose() function.
        23.Fixed parameter <DLLImport Charset:=..  > 
        24.Fixed sorting, then double-clicking in Find window.
        25.Fixed autofix: If all variables in a Structure are dead, 
           don't removes them. A Structure without variables is illegal.
        26.Fixed autofix: Adding return typename to property named P.
        27.Fixed autofix: Don't remove dead Interface procedures if
           they are implemented. VB.NET refuses to compile implementor.
        28.Fixed autofix: Don't remove Overrides base procedures or
           children of MustOverride when required to compile.

        *** Code review rule changes ***
        1. Classification changes
         - Return value discarded: Style -> Dead code
         - Variable/function/constant missing type declaration:
           Optimization -> Style
         - Case Else missing: Style -> Functionality
        2. "Case Else missing" now reported at Select Case line.
           Move any '$PROBHIDE CASE_ELSE next to Select Case.
           Case Else is no longer required if existing Case branches 
           cover all theoretically possible input values.

        *** VB.NET Compatibility Check changes ***
        1. Rules updated to cover upgrading code from VB6 to VB2008, 
           with Visual Basic Power Packs 3.0 installed.
        2. Removed compatibility rules (and reason why removed):
           - Circle and Oval controls unsupported (use Power Packs)
           - No control arrays (automated upgrade now available)
           - vbAlias unavailable (replacement available)
           - ByVal/ByRef missing (upgrade wizard works correctly now)
             (feedback by Torsten Borg)

        *** Metrics changes ***
        1. TCC for classes includes Custom Event accessors. May increase
           slightly.
        2. Values of SC, SYSC and RSYSC may have changed significantly 
           due to improved analysis.

        *** VBA Plug changes ***
        1. VBA Plug v2 is required for Project Analyzer v9. 
           Old version VBA Plug v1 is no longer compatible.
        2. Command line option /Q quits VBA Plug after export.
           (Sven Wittorf)

        *** Removed features ***
        1. Project Analyzer no longer supports Windows 95 or NT.
           It may work, but support is not maintained.
